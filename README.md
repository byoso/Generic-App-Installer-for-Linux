# Generic App Installer for Linux

version: 1.0.1

This script is a launcher maker, the same kind you already have in many linux distros,
BUT :
- this one allowes the user to integrate the application to he's system's menu easily.
- this one allowes an easy way to handle the "categories" of the '.desktop' file
Well, if you have interest in creating lanchers quick and easy, you should try this script.


## Usage
- Use for yourself: you can just copy this script in your '~/bin' directory (Ubuntu and some other distros), to keep it at hand. No need to explain much here, the interface of the script is simple and self explaining enought :)
- For distributing apps, provide this file alongside your application.


### Compatibility
This works perfectly fine with .py, .sh, .appimage executables. If the executable needs to be launched with some specific options, you'll have to manually edit the obtained .desktop file.
