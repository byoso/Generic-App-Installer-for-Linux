# Launcher Maker

version: 1.0.0

This script is a launcher maker, the same kind you already have in many linux distros,  
BUT this one is much more convenient (at least for Ubuntu and mint),  
BUT this one is only a terminal script  :'( (no prob buddy, you can drag n drop files in a terminal !),  
BUT this one allowes an easy way to handle the "categories" of the '.desktop' file :D.  
Well, if you have interest in creating lanchers quick and easy, you should try this script.  


## Requirements
There is a bit of interface, so:  
```python
pip install flamewok
```

## Usage
I recommand to just copy this script in your '~/bin' directory (Ubuntu and some other distros), to keep it at hand. No need to explain much here, the interface of the script is simple and self explaining enought :)
